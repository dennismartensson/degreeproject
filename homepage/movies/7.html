  <p> In the previous movie I talk about webRTC and how it works. In this movie we will go right in to the code. First I will show you a demo and then the code to create the demo. I will explain the webRTC stuff and show you the normal javascript and html code that creates the demo. This is build like a library and you find the code over on <a href="https://github.com/webRTC" target="_bland">github</a>
